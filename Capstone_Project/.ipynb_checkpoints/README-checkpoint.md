### Overview

The film industry has historically experienced fluctuations of both booms and busts. However, with the advent of streaming services like Netflix and Disney+, films and movies are continually gaining popularity and more exposure through such streaming services. The author, hence, chose to explore into data revolving the movie industry. 



### Problem Statement

As we usher in an information era, the average consumer is often times overloaded with data and information. From organizations being willing to pay copious amounts of money for online brand visibility through advertisements, to ecommerce/search engines presenting hundreds or even thousands of results with valid search keywords, the importance of distilling and presenting key, relevant information has become more important than ever. Recommender engines play a key role in today's information-rich climate, hence the author chose to explore deeper into the application of recommender engines on the IMDb dataset.
